terra Tutorial
================
terra is a Pyhton code developed to reproduce the chemical pattern of a solar twin and estimate the amount of 
rocky material presents in the convective zone. terra consist in two codes, the first to determine the 
convective mass of a solar twin and the second to reproduce the chemical pattern of them.

Convective Mass
----------------
We developed the code called convective_mass.py, which computes the convective mass of any solar twin by using the
theoretical models from Siess et al. (2000). Just open tha terminal and run de code as:

python convective_mass.py
Mass of the solar twin (Msun): 0.80              ----> introduce the mass of your solar twin
Metallicity [X/H]            : 0.09              ----> introduce the metallicity
=====================================
The convective mass is (Msun): 0.058             ----> convective mass estimated
=====================================


Chemical pattern
